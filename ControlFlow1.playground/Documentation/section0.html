		There are fundamentally two types of control flow structures in Swift.
		Loops and Conditional Statements. Loops are handled by using &#39;for&#39;, &#39;while&#39; and &#39;do while&#39;. 
		Conditional Statements are handled using &#39;if else&#39; and &#39;switch&#39;. 
		</p>
		<p>
		There is some more terminology that goes along with each type of control flow. 
		This chapter tries to explain the way loops are handled in Swift Programming Language.

A loop is a way of executing a task multiple times. 
Usually there is a condition that needs to be satisfied to repeat the loop. 
The loop execution stops when the condition is not met to repeat the loop, 
or if there is a use of &#39;continue&#39; or &#39;break&#39; keywords to break the flow of execution. 
This is explained in detail in the below sample code and examples.

The first type of for loop is for-in loop. It lets you evaluate through a range of values, 
or each item in a collection of items.
The below lines of code check values between 2 and 9 and print if the value is even or odd.
