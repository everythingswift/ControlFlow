		<b>Using &#39;continue&#39; and &#39;break&#39; in do-while loop:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
		As with &#39;continue&#39; and &#39;break&#39; in &#39;while&#39; statement, 
		they do similar change in control flow even in do-while statement. 
		Using &#39;continue&#39; will execute next iteration of do-while loop, 
		where as &#39;break&#39; will pass on the control flow following the do-while loop.
		</p>
		The above example code is rewritten and using &#39;continue&#39; and &#39;break&#39; 
		in the below snippet.
