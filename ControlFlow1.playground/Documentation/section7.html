		<p>
		do while - A do while loop executes the task at least once before checking the 
		condition to execute the loop next time. 
		The same string search example used earlier in &#39;while&#39; example is rewritten
		 below for do while loop. 
		 The major change here is that the while condition is checked at the end of each loop
		  to verify if it needs to execute the task again.
